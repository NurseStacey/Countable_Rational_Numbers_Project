Here is a program to demonstrate the countability of the positive rational numbers. For a set to be countable there needs to be a 1-1 mapping between it and the natural numbers.
The mapping in the program is both 1-1 and onto meaning that you can go back and forth between the two sets.  Each natural numbers goes to one positive rational number and visa-versa.  My hope is that
this may help young math students to understand the idea of countability and that a set can appear to be much bigger than the natural numbers and still be the same size.
